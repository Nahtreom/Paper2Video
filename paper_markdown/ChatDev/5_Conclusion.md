# 5 Conclusion  

We have introduced ChatDev, an innovative multiagent collaboration framework for software development that utilizes multiple LLM-powered agents to integrate fragmented phases of the waterfall model into a cohesive communication system. It features chat chain organizing communication targets and dehallucination for resolving coding hallucinations. The results demonstrate its superiority and highlight the benefits of multi-turn communications in software optimization. We aim for the insights to advance LLM agents towards increased autonomy and illuminate the profound effects of "language" and its empowering role across an even broader spectrum of applications.
