# 3.1 Inference of MAS  
In order to unify and streamline the diverse MAS codebases in the field, MASLab focuses on four key aspects during inference that ensure consistency and fairness across different methods: representation of MAS, inputs, configurations, and accessible resources. These aspects are designed to eliminate the disparities that have traditionally hindered cross-method comparisons and replication of results.
