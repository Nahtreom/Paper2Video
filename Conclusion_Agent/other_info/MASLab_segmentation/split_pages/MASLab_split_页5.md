Shared resources. MASLab unifies the underlying resources required by MAS methods, including LLMs and external tools. It supports both externally hosted APIs and locally deployed models, covering a wide range of widely used LLMs. The integrated toolkit provides common utilities such as code execution (secured via sandboxing [52]), web search, and image analysis—capabilities frequently required across MAS designs. These shared components eliminate redundant engineering effort and facilitate reproducibility. Moreover, MASLab is designed to be extensible and compatible with ongoing open-source developments (e.g., MCP [53]), ensuring long-term adaptability.
