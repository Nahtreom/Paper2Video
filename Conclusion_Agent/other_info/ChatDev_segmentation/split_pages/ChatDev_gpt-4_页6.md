The dual-agent communication design simplifies communications by avoiding complex multi-agent topologies, effectively streamlining the consensusreaching process (Yin et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b). Subsequently, the solutions from previous tasks serve as bridges to the next phase, allowing a smooth transition between subtasks. This approach continues until all subtasks are completed. It’s worth noting that the conceptually simple but empirically powerful chain-style structure guides agents on what to communicate, fostering cooperation and smoothly linking natural- and programming-language subtasks. It also offers a transparent view of the entire software development process, allowing for the examination of intermediate solutions and assisting in identifying possible problems.
