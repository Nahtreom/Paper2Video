Agentization To enhance the quality and reduce human intervention, ChatDev implements prompt engineering that only takes place at the start of each subtask round. As soon as the communication phase begins, the instructor and the assistant will communicate with each other in an automated loop, continuing this exchange until the task concludes. However, simply exchanging responses cannot achieve effective multi-round task-oriented communication, since it inevitably faces significant challenges including role flipping, instruction repeating, and fake replies. As a result, there is a failure to advance the progression of productive communications and hinders the achievement of meaningful solutions.
