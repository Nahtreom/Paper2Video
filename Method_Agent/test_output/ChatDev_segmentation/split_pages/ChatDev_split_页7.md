Memory Note that the limited context length of common LLMs typically restricts the ability to maintain a complete communication history among all agents and phases. To tackle this issue, based on the nature of the chat chain, we accordingly segment the agents’ context memories based on their sequential phases, resulting in two functionally distinct types of memory: short-term memory and long-term memory. Short-term memory is utilized to sustain the continuity of the dialogue within a single phase, while long-term memory is leveraged to preserve contextual awareness across different phases.
