Streamlined representation of MAS. Each MAS method within MASLab is abstracted into a Python class, all of which inherit from a common base class. This base class provides shared functionality across methods, such as making LLM requests and tracking LLM token consumptions. The core of each method is the inference function, which takes a data sample (e.g., a mathematical problem) as input and outputs the solution generated by the MAS. By standardizing the representation in this manner, the structure of each MAS approach is simplified, allowing researchers to gain a clear understanding of the key steps involved by merely inspecting the inference function. In many cases, the inference process is further modularized, with specific components encapsulated as additional functions to highlight the different stages of task-solving, such as team recruitment and code execution. This design ensures that the complexity inherent in different MAS methods is handled in a consistent, easily interpretable manner, while preserving the unique features of each individual approach. For optimization-based methods [18, 32, 30], another core optimization function will process a validation set to produce an optimized MAS. See re-implementation notes in Section D.
