In every subtask, two agents, each with their own specialized roles (e.g., a reviewer skilled at identifying endless loops and a programmer adept in GUI design), perform the functions of an instructor $( { \mathcal { T } } )$ and an assistant $( \mathcal { A } )$ . The instructor agent initiates instructions, instructing $(  )$ the discourse toward the completion of the subtask, while the assistant agent adheres to these instructions and responds with $( \sim )$ appropriate solutions. They engage in a multi-turn dialogue (C), working cooperatively until they achieve consensus, extracting $( \tau )$ solutions that can range from the text (e.g., defining a software function point) to code (e.g., creating the initial version of source code), ultimately leading to the completion of the subtask.
